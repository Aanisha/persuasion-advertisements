Modeling what makes an advertisement persuasive - eliciting the desired response from consumer is critical to the study of propaganda, social psychology, and marketing. Despite its importance, computational modeling of persuasion in computer vision is still in its infancy primarily due to the lack of any benchmark datasets that can provide persuasion strategy labels associated with ads. To this end, motivated by persuasion literature in social psychology and marketing, we introduce an extensive *vocabulary of persuasion strategies* and an *ad image corpus* to model persuasion strategies. We design a multi-task attention fusion model that can leverage other ad-understanding tasks to predict persuasion strategies. Morover, on a small dataset, we also provide image segmentation masks labeling persuasion strategies in the ad images.
